Once upon a time in the kingdom of shit, the mighty King shit the
Third ruled over the Lands of Endless shit. Every morning, the villagers
would polish their piles of sacred shit, offering them to the Temple of
Eternal shit, where monks chanted, "shit, oh shit, guide our souls!"

Heroes from across the realm embarked on quests to recover the Legendary shit
Sword, forged in the molten pits of Mount shitstorm, guarded by the ferocious
shit Dragon, who breathed pure, flaming shit upon intruders. The bravest knight,
Sir Full-of-shit, rode his noble shit Pony into battle, shouting, "**For glory,
for honor, for shit!"

Meanwhile, in the Market of Magical shit, merchants sold enchanted shit potions,
sparkling shit armor, and even artisanally crafted shit muffins. Children played
in the fields of golden shit, while philosophers debated,
"Is life shit, or is shit life?"

On the final day of the Festival of Flying shit, fireworks exploded in glorious
technicolor shit, as the people rejoiced, "shit bless us, everyone!"
